# SoundCloud Enhancer #

## Description: ##
----------------------------------------
SoundCloud Enhancer alters the look and functionality of the platform. You can change the whole website to a sexy looking dark theme, together with other changes to the layout like sidebar removal and stream listing design. One of the biggest features allows you to ban specific tags in your stream, so you only listen to the genres that you enjoy. Please send me suggestions and report bugs upon using my extension.
